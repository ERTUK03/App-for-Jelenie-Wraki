# App-for-Jelenie-Wraki
Just an app made as an aid to my uncle organising car races

# Requirements
-C++20

-Boost/asio

-wxWidgets

# Description
Whole point of this app was to help my uncle with managing scoreboard of car races he organises. The app is made to work with RFID receivers connected with antennas
detecting cars equiped with RFID tags. From the data received on COM port, the program outputs loopes completed by each car, score and place.

I aimed to make GUI suitable for inexperienced user so hopefully it's crystal clear.
